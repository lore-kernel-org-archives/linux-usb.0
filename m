Great. After that you might want to take a look and make sure that musb
also gets idled properly during runtime with no devices connected :)

Hmm maybe we're just missing the check for suspend here. Maybe
give the following untested patch a try?

I'll give it a try here too but it might be few days.

Seems like we might be able to eventually simplify the suspend and
quirk check stuff, but let's fix the $subject issue first.
