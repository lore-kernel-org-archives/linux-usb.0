I disagree with that statement.  Who decided that mice are supposed to 
be wakeup devices?

Even worse, if a mouse is enabled for wakeup then the system may get 
woken up at the wrong time.  The example people often use is a laptop 
with a USB mouse thrown into a backpack while it is asleep.  Something 
else inside the backpack may accidentally press against a mouse button, 
causing the system to wake up even though the user wants it to remain 
asleep.
