I=E2=80=99m sorry. I should have included an attribution.
That was my oversight.

I did use an LLM this time to assist with the audit and translation. It p=
erformed variant analysis on the code around 8c6314489550, identified the=
se three issues, and wrote the patches and changelog. I ran the build, re=
viewed the results, decided what was worth submitting, and sent everythin=
g out. The Signed-off-by line is mine, and I take responsibility for this=
 work.

I have now read =E2=81=A0coding-assistants.rst and =E2=81=A0generated-con=
tent.rst. The following has been added to all three patches in v2:

Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-5 asan

The cover letter also explains what the tool did and what I did. There ar=
e no code changes compared with v1.

Thank you,

HE WEI
