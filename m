No, there is no such list.

Yes, we could do that.  But the filename would have to be the string 
id, which is not meaningful.  We wouldn't be able to have labels like 
"product-info" unless somehow a driver could provide the label.

Also, there's the matter of language.  Devices can have string 
descriptors in multiple languages; which one should we show in sysfs?  
All of them?  Right now we use just the default language for the strings 
that we put in sysfs.

This is unavoidable to some extent.  Without device-specific information 
or userspace code, there is no way to know which string descriptor 
contains the data you want.
