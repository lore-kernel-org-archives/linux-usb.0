I don't know if we support REBAR or how well in PCIe side, Ilpo probably
knows that. Typically there is just certain amount of resources allocated
for each PCIe root port that gets tunneled so the way to do this is to
increase that in the BIOS. Having said that most of the vendors don't
actually allow it to be changed.

BIOS assist mode is a workaround for early Windows systems that did not
support native PCIe hotplug. It should not be used in any modern systems
and I doubt it's not even capable of what you are doing.

I would say here that it's not even related to the underlying transport,
could be something else than TB too, as long as PCIe goes inside.
