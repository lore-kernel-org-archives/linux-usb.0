Thanks for checking.  That code ended up not helping the original issue 
it was for, a different solution for that issue is being provided.

But I'm wondering, is this issue you're working on something to do with 
pm_async?  Could you turn that off and see if it improves anything?

Any chance you can get UART output from the system using a debug board 
over suspend/resume in case there is a panic happening that doesn't 
flush to NVME?
