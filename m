Subject: xHCI TT: FS audio capture glitches when btusb SCO runs concurrently

Hi,

I'd like to report (and ask for guidance on) an apparent conflict between
two concurrent full-speed isochronous streams on the same xHCI controller:
a full-speed USB audio device behind a hub (split transactions through the
hub's TT) and the SCO endpoints of an Intel Bluetooth controller (btusb)
on a root port.

Short version: while an HFP call is active over Bluetooth (SCO), the
capture stream of a full-speed USB headset plugged in *behind a dock hub*
is subtly corrupted. After mSBC encoding and the telephony path, the far
end hears severely "robotic" audio. Moving the same headset to a direct
root port makes the problem disappear immediately; moving it back behind
the dock brings it back. CVSD calls are perceptually unaffected.

Environment
-----------
- ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th gen; xHCI: Intel Sunrise Point-LP [8086:9d2f]
- Kernel 7.1.3-1-default (openSUSE Tumbleweed), BlueZ 5.82,
   PipeWire 1.6.8 / WirePlumber 0.5.15 (HFP native backend, laptop = HF)
- Bluetooth: Intel 8265 [8087:0a2b], full-speed, internal (bus 1 root
   port 7), fw ibt-12-16
- USB headset: C-Media [0d8c:0014], full-speed, mono capture 48 kHz
- Dock: Lenovo USB dock (hubs 17ef:3071/17ef:3070, cascade incl.
   067b:2586 and 05e3:0610)
- HFP counterpart: Android phone (Volla X23) as AG; a call was placed to
   a second handset held at my ear, so I judged the far-end quality
   directly while speaking

SCO detail during mSBC: eSCO, air mode Transparent, 60-byte RX/TX packet
length, btusb isoc alt setting 1 (9-byte packets), HCI SCO frames
dlen 24. CVSD uses alt setting 2 (17-byte packets).

Reproduction (single call, changing only the capture source / port)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I kept the same position and speech style throughout and judged the
quality on the far-end handset:

   uplink capture source                    far-end verdict
   1. HS webcam (behind the same dock)      clean
   2. FS headset behind dock hub A          severely "robotic"
   3. same, headset moved 30 cm away        severely "robotic"
                                            (rules out mic proximity/level)
   4. FS headset on a DIRECT root port      clean
   5. FS headset behind dock hub B          severely "robotic" again
                                            (immediately reversible)

A parallel capture of the same source during phase 5 (recording to a file
while the stream also feeds the call) contains audible subtle glitching
already at the capture side -- i.e. the corruption exists in the USB
capture data before any Bluetooth/mSBC processing. Amplitude analysis
shows no zero-runs or full-scale clicks, so the defect consists of small
sample-level discontinuities, which the frame-based mSBC codec then
amplifies into severe artifacts, while sample-based CVSD mostly masks
them.

What I ruled out
----------------
- Bluetooth host stack: btmon traces covering a clean -> robotic -> clean
   cycle show the HCI SCO TX stream is byte-perfect (intact 60-byte mSBC
   framing with H2 headers, ~3333 frames/10 s constant) and the write
   timing pattern is identical between clean and robotic phases (bursts of
   3x24 B every ~7.5 ms). The RX direction is likewise clean. So
   BlueZ/PipeWire/btusb submit correct data on time; the corruption
   happens elsewhere.
- Audio content/level: same speech, same position (phase 3).
- The specific adapter/hub: reproduced behind two different hub chains,
   and with a different FS combo headset (Sennheiser) behind a different
   (Thunderbolt) dock in another location -- there the mSBC *downlink*
   died completely while CVSD kept working.
- PipeWire graph effects: an *idle* parallel capture from the FS device
   behind the dock (both via PipeWire and via direct ALSA hw:) does NOT
   disturb a call whose uplink comes from the HS webcam -- the corruption
   only matters when the TT capture stream is the one feeding the call.
   Consistent with the corruption being on the TT capture stream itself.

Possibly related: "Bluetooth: hci0: corrupted SCO packet" bursts (~14-32
messages) at SCO setup time, with both codecs, transient. Earlier this
year, on 6.18.8 with the Thunderbolt dock setup, mSBC showed frequent
decode errors but audio still flowed; I have not bisected.

Questions
---------
1. Is this a known limitation of xHCI TT split-isochronous scheduling
    with two concurrent FS isoc streams (one behind a TT, one on a root
    port)? EHCI had a software TT scheduler
    (CONFIG_USB_EHCI_TT_NEWSCHED); as far as I can tell xHCI relies on
    hardware scheduling with no equivalent knob.
2. Which captures would help most? I can provide btmon traces (a 26 MB
    clean/robotic cycle), usbmon captures, xhci dynamic debug logs and
    audio samples, and I'm happy to test patches.

Best regards,
