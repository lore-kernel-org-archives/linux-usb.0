You're missing an important fact: If something goes wrong during the 
hibernation transition (for example, if the kernel's memory image can't 
be stored to disk) then there will be no RESTORE phase.  Following the 
THAW phase, the system will return to normal operation.

For this reason, during THAW drivers must not assume that the system is 
about to power down.
