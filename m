Oh; Dell has a special way to handle this from EC communication with 
Dell docks that is separate from USB4 wake on connect settings.  So even 
without a driver loaded the Dell dock should be able to wake the Dell 
system.

But I expect it would break non-Dell systems USB4 wake on connect settings.
