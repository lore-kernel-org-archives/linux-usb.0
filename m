This is... surprising:
these commits are restoring the previous behavior that has been running
under linux for the past 20+ years, that was broken by 0a3fe972a7cb
("HID: core: Mitigate potential OOB by removing bogus memset()").

So basically, there was a short period of time in 7.0 (it was introduced
in 7.0-rc5) where the device would have been working fine.

Can you check if kernel v6.18.21 (the last one before 0a3fe972a7cb was
backported to the 6.18 series) was also showing the behavior? I strongly
suspect it will, unless there was a USB change that also triggered this
bug.

anyway...

ouch, very much ouch

Yes. This is expected

That is seriously wrong. It's not uncommon for keyboards to expose a
mouse node when the support "macros" that you can configure in their
firmware. That allows them to send button events, or even control the mouse.

That being said, if your keyboard reacts to USB events from other
devices, then there is something seriously wrong in the firmware.

In any cases, the fix is not to revert the restored behavior, but to fix
your bogus device.

No, this is not possible, the behavior was restored because it broke
several devices.

Well, you have 2 options actually:
- write a new kernel driver that maps to the device and discards short
  reports emitted on the mouse node
- or write a HID-BPF program (see
  https://libevdev.pages.freedesktop.org/udev-hid-bpf/tutorial.html)
  that does exactly that as well, but it's simpler to debug/implement
  because you don't need a full kernel rebuild.

I don't see the benefit of adding a new generic quirk for fixing 1
device.

If I were you, I would seriously lean toward a HID-BPF program, because
that's much easier to write and test.

Cheers,
Benjamin
