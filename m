Hi Yoshihiro,

sorry for not taking care of this earlier, today is a public holiday
here and thus I'm not working much over the long weekend.

Oh, I hadn't even look at why USB uses blk_queue_virt_boundary, and it
seems like the usage is wrong, as it doesn't follow the same rules as
all the others.  I think your patch goes in the right direction,
but instead of comparing a hcd name it needs to be keyed of a flag
set by the driver (I suspect there is one indicating native SG support,
but I can't quickly find it), and we need an alternative solution
for drivers that don't see like vhci.  I suspect just limiting the
entire transfer size to something that works for a single packet
for them would be fine.
