Something like that. I'm very biased as I mostly work on multimedia
devices, but it feels to me that for many drivers the current
hibernation procedure is too complex. Those drivers don't need to
differentiate suspend and hibernation, they only need to be instructed
to suspend at some point, and resume later. Resuming could occur when
the system is woken up, or when hibernation fails in the THAW phase, and
those drivers wouldn't care to differentiate between the two. Seeing an
extra resume + suspend cycle due to the hibernation machinery needing to
write the image to disk, and having to handle that cycle manually as in
this series, is additional complexity that (unless I'm missing
something) could be handled by the PM core.

I wasn't even aware this was a thing, which only strengthen my
conviction that we're making it too difficult for many drivers :-)
