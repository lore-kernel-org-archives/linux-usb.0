So far we haven't found an asus device that has more than one interface
that supports reading data out of if.

While I mostly agree with this it is also true that the general direction
for the kernel (especially lately) has been to not do out-of-spec things
at least by default.

If things really regress it's expected to do so only an very few specific
devices with a buggy firmware, and we can think of something different
for those (hopefully very few ones).

Perhaps someone concerned with security might be interested in what
we have because it doesn't look very normal.

Note that below I have written a few ideas that maybe are worth
looking into.

Simply opening an hidraw should not trigger a delayed disconnect of that device,
I don't know why you would expect this to happen nor why you would
consider it acceptable. It's a bug.

Focusing on userspace software exposing the bug is not a realistic option
because over the time we found a good chunk of software doing that:
- logitech control software (forgot the name)
- open razer software
- sdl
- asusctl (obviously it opens the device albeit in the future I will change this)

and likely more given the fact not all software was identified.

I found and solved the bug already. Regardless the issue remains:
Even with no asusctl at all, if a user has one logitech mouse
(and its control software) and a razer keyboard (and its control software)
the asus N-Key device will start an endless disconnect-reconnect loop.

Any combination of two or more of those tools will trigger the issue
on some devices (weirdly enough not every model is affected):
this is not good.

Sure, and I agree with you that fixing all userspace tools is desirable
but it's also unfeasible to fix them all, if we managed to do that
there will be years before everyone receives a fixed version of every
affected software and even then a core issue would remain:
linux tries to poll something it can't have anything out from.

I am much more oriented on the fact that kernel shouldn't
be doing weird things (at least not by default) so this has to
somehow be stopped regardless of how well userspace behaves.

If you have better ideas on how to fix the kernel we would
like to hear those as well.

I will write my review here to avoid forking the discussion:

I agree with the general idea but perhaps we can avoid
some hid devices to ever get HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL
and that might be enough to skip the problematic code?

Maybe there is value in doing this with a quirk flag in hid-asus.c
affecting the least amount of devices?

Or maybe just prevent devices with no data possibly coming out
to ever get HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL?

For how to best do this we will need to hear what Jiri and
Benjamin have to say but if they think the proposed solution
is the correct solution:
