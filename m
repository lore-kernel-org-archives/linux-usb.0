I missed this part of the response. Here I'd add that
HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL is part of six if statements so your patch is
not equivalent to HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL. If it should be, perhaps an
alternative for fixing just asus devices would be to OR that quirk
when hid-asus initializes for all devices. I am not sure if it is a
firmware issue, if it is a kernel issue that can be mitigated without
quirks or skipping enabling the in endpoint, I'd prefer that. Failing
that, a quirk would perhaps limit the affected devices
