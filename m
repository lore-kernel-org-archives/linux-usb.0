Actually there is dmesg.6+hotplug_egpu_2 and lspci-vv.6+hotplug_egpu_2.
Sorry missed that.

The first GPU seems to fit fine:

[   24.538295] nvidia 0000:66:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0003)
[   24.539803] nvidia 0000:66:00.0: vgaarb: VGA decodes changed: olddecodes=io+mem,decodes=none:owns=none
[   24.590905] NVRM: loading NVIDIA UNIX Open Kernel Module for x86_64  610.43.02  Release Build  (portage@localhost)  Wed Jun 10 19:38:57 -00 2026

But then the second one has not enough resources left, the 55:03.0
downstream port that is used to connect the second GPU has only these left:

   I/O behind bridge: b000-bfff [size=4K] [16-bit]
   Memory behind bridge: 66e00000-6a2fffff [size=53M] [32-bit]
   Prefetchable memory behind bridge: [disabled] [64-bit]

Some BIOSes has an option that you can increase the amount of resources for
the root ports but some vendors hide it.
