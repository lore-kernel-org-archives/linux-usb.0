Well then you have to accept that root can provoke a null pointer
exception (e.g. by forcing the pwm-tegra driver on a device) because at
least with today's platform bus match function such a match is ok.

I agree in principle, but (in my case wifi) drivers are buggy sometimes
(due to missing documentation and/or engineering effort) and being able
to rebind the driver instead of rebooting to get a working device again
is very useful.

So yes, theoretically bind/unbind isn't needed, but theory and practise
differ in practise.

OK, as a compromise: Let's keep the taint (after all that's not
destroying any functionality, just adding a hint for bug reports),
and make driver_override opt-in, which should close an attack surface
(mostly for fuzzers?) and so reduce the amount of bug reports instead of
marking a part of them as tainted only.

Best regards
Uwe
