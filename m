This was my discovery as well which blocked my Resizable BAR aware 
resource sizing from doing anything. I did some work to solve it but then 
got regressions from the earlier resource work to address so I've not had 
time to look into this for a while.

Solving this is among the last few blockers for the resizable BAR-aware 
resource sizing (sans the yet to be discovered bugs in the resizable 
BAR-aware code itself).

It's a known problem, but fixing it without introducing regressions is not 
easy. The solution must be able to fallback gracefully to smaller sizes 
as needed. Without that, a regression that will surely come up soonish 
would just lead reverting the improvment.

Yes, infact patches already exist to consired ReBAR during resource 
fitting, but they just don't run as is when a bridge is already assigned
so more work is still needed once I get the most recent set of regressions 
out of the way first.

I've no plans on basing anything on that work.

In some cases, removing siblings that pin any of the upstream bridge 
windows in place prior to executing the resize may allow the entire window 
to move elsewhere.

There's even a patch from Geramy Loveless that would do this automatically 
for empty siblings [1] which is definitely worth a try. It does not work 
universally, however, so YMMV (I don't see your /proc/iomem anywhere so I 
cannot tell whether it likely works in your case).

Somebody was against Geramy's patch as it didn't (and kind of doesn't 
even want to) ensure the unused siblings would be guaranteed to be 
allocated at least some space after the resize (any unused hotplug 
reservation is "optional" so it would be a major change to alter that 
differentiation to address that review comment).

But if that patch works for you, sending your Tested-by tag to its thread 
might actually be helpful.
