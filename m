Yes most likely because a single GPU takes lots of resources and there is
quite small window reserved per root port for example:

  Memory behind bridge: 60000000-6c1fffff [size=194M] [32-bit]
  Prefetchable memory behind bridge: 6040000000-605bffffff [size=448M] [32-bit]

Looking at your logs you have all 4 PCIe root ports for tunneling listed
there so I would expect you have 4 USB4/TB ports available as well
(typically the root ports not available for tunneling will not be visible
to the OS).

There seems to be no dmesg + lspci without the command line parameters? Can
you do this:

  1. Remove all the non-default command line parameters.
  2. Boot the system up, nothing connected.
  3. Plug in the USB4 dock, enable PCIe tunnel (this probably is automatic)
  4. Plug in the first eGPU to the dock, enable PCIe tunnel
  5. Plug in the second eGPU to the dock, enable PCIe tunnel

From this take full dmesg and output of 'sudo lspci -vv'. At least we can
see how the "default" kernel resource allocation fails.

Okay that tells the BIOS does not even try to assign the resources for
both of them.
