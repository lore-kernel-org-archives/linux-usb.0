All of this seems fairly complicated to me for devices that have no role
to play whatsoever in the hibernation image write, and that's probably
the majority of devices.

Is there a reason a driver couldn't set a flag at probe time to tell the
device doesn't care about hibernation, and have the PM core skip the
resume in the THAW phase, instead resuming only when THAW fails ?
