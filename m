The ASUS ROG N-Key Device does have feature reports. They are used for=20
RGB control on the keyboard. I have confirmed this with a test by not=20
registering the hidraw node for this interface at all and noted that RGB=20
stops working after. So hiding or ejecting this interface is not an=20
option. Therefore, after this patch, I myself, together with Kerim and=20
GameBurrow have paid attention explicitly to ensure there are no=20
regressions to the LED controls, while fixing the keyboard issue.

Also worth noting that feature reports travel over EP0 via=20
usbhid_{get,set}_raw_report() in both directions. The interrupt IN=20
endpoint is only ever used to receive input reports: hid_irq_in() passes=20
everything it gets to hid_safe_input_report(HID_INPUT_REPORT, ...).=20
There is no code in usbhid that reads feature reports from the interrupt=20
IN endpoint at all, so skipping that poll cannot break any feature=20
reports on any device. This is also mentioned in my patch description:

=09"Feature reports and hidraw output keep working over the control and=20
OUT endpoints, so the interface is otherwise unaffected."

Regarding a manufacturer using in endpoint without an input report, even=20
today, the HID core would drop that data before it reaches hidraw:=20
__hid_input_report() bails when hid_get_report() finds no matching=20
report. That bail is also before the driver's ->raw_event() callback, so=20
no driver or hidraw reader can currently be relying on such traffic.

Affected devices include the ROG STRIX 2025 lineup: Scar 16/18=20
(G635L/G835L) and G16/G18 (G615L/G815L). My patch has been tested on=20
both Scar 18 and G18. Additionally a user with a Scar 18 2024 model=20
(G634JZR) has reported the issue as well; they were unable to=20
participate in testing but reproduce the issue with the same cat command=20
(reproduction command provided below). It is likely the G16/G18 of 2024=20
will also be affected. Models prior to 2024 appear unaffected so far.

A user with an Xbox Ally X has tested this for me as well as of writing=20
this email. So we are able to confirm that this device is unaffected and=20
no regressions are noticed on that device from my patch, including the=20
lamp/RGB controls.

I do not have access to a Z13 at the moment. If you have one, it would=20
be very helpful for me if you could test for any regressions on that=20
device and if the device is affected by the bug, and whether or not this=20
patch fixes the issue.

I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that the 3 testers=20
and I are all daily driving a kernel with this patch applied, and over=20
the last few days, have noticed no issues with any devices.

The reproduction scenario is in the patch description:

=09"Opening its hidraw node (any hidraw reader does, including SDL/Steam=20
Input or a plain cat) starts the pointless IN poll and keypress reports=20
on the keyboard interface get dropped for as long as the node stays=20
open: a lost key-down drops a letter, a lost key-up leaves the key stuck."

i.e. run "sudo timeout 15 cat /dev/hidrawX" against the N-Key RGB=20
interface, then type on the internal keyboard.

What the patch does is the last paragraph of the description:

=09"Skip the poll in usbhid_open() when the device has no input reports."

Interrupt IN endpoint on a device with 0 input reports isn't doing=20
anything anyway. The other things the early return skips only matter=20
when input is possible.

As per my investigations with usbmon, I can see that the keyboard=20
interface's input reports never reach the URB layer while the RGB=20
interface is being polled. From the patch description:

=09"usbmon shows the dropped reports never reach the URB layer"

So the blocking likely happens inside the device's firmware, and not in=20
the kernel, so the kernel cannot fix that part. What the kernel can do=20
is to stop arming the IN URB on an endpoint that as per its own=20
descriptor, can never produce data.

Thank you for the review!

I would like to also highlight one thing here; the HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL=20
is not given to this specific device. It was already in the if=20
condition, for the devices that do use it; my change only ORs a second=20
independent condition into it. So keeping devices away from that quirk=20
would not change anything here.

Adding a quirk flag for this specific device is something I too have=20
considered and will be happy to change it like so if Jiri or Benjamin=20
feel it is more appropriate. My reasoning for taking the current route=20
is that it would prevent any hidden issues that might arise similarly,=20
and fix the whole class of this issue rather than for one vendor when=20
the likelihood of a regression is very low from skipping interrupt IN=20
polling if a device doesn't have input reports in the first place.

Best Regards,
Yaseen
