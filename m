The kernel is not doing weird things and I also did not ask you to fix
all userspace software. I asked for a reproduction scenario, as it is
not covered in the patch description. Relooking at the patch today, I
also do not understand what it does fully.

It skips enabling input interrupts (but not only that) for devices
that have no input reports. So the kernel behavior will depend on the
feature descriptor moving forward.

And that fixes a hang on the affected devices because enabling
interrupts on an endpoint without periodic input reports blocks a
parallel endpoint that does have input reports?

I would like this fix to target the actual cause that causes the block
but it is not clear to me what that is or what is affected.
