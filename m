Given that DMAR prefix this seems to be about using intel-iommu + bounce
buffering for external devices.  I can't really think of anything specific
in 5.10 related to that, so maybe you'll need to bisect.

I doub this means we are actually leaking swiotlb buffers, so while
I'm pretty sure we broke something in lower layers this also means
xhci doesn't handle swiotlb operation very gracefully in general.
