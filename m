You didn't include the version number in the Subject: line.  Undoubtedly 
Greg's automatic error checker will warn you about this.  Unless the 
version number is clearly marked for each patch, it's difficult for his 
programs to tell which email message contains the most recent version.

And you didn't include the version change information here, below the 
"---" line.

Apart from that, this is a _lot_ better than before!  I don't know if 
Greg will think this change is worth merging, but at least now it's 
possible to read the code and understand what's going on.
