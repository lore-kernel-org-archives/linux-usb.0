Great!  Okay, here's an actual patch for you to try.  I have removed 
the blk_queue_update_dma_alignment() call because it doesn't seem to 
be necessary.  The starting location of each scatterlist element is 
unimportant; only the length matters.

If this works, I will submit it as a bugfix for the kernel.
